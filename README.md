# Programming in Haskell
This repository contains solutions to selected programming exercises from
[*Programming in Haskell (2nd edition)*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52573728-programming-in-haskell).

Note that this is a personal learning place that was created while
reading the book. I do encourage others to buy and read it!

Exercises can be found in an [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell)
notebook. In order to view and edit it one can start a Docker container
running Jupyter with IHaskell kernel via
```bash
make ihaskell
```
